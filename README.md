# Nebula

## About
 Nebula is a custom made rank/permission system. It is currently a mix of flatfile & MySQL. 
 
## How it works
 When creating a rank the rank will be put into the database automatically.
 Permissions for the ranks can be set in the permissions.yml (before going into the permisisons.yml make sure todo /ranks perm add <rank> <node>)
 Users for setting user permissions/inheritance it is all currently saved in users.yml (same deal as above /users perm add <player> <node>)
 
## Plans for the final build
 Fully switch to saving everything to a database, making ranks & permissions server based if set.
